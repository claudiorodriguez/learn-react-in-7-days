# Learn React in 7 days

This is a step-by-step journey through the React ecosystem.

It is intended to help you gain a basic working knowledge of it in 7 days.
It will focus on small steps, each simple to follow, each with a working result.

We'll start with an empty folder, and build on it more and more until we end up with a full app.
The focus is intended to be narrow. Consider it a "wedge" that you will widen through your own experimentation and research.

This guide is *not* any form of boilerplate, please don't use the code in it in a real application.

This project is designed to be read directly from Github.

## Requirements

This repo is intended towards developers with an existing intermediate to advanced familiarity with JS.

I recommend [You Don't Know JS][you-dont-know-js] if you haven't read that yet - great stuff.

You will also need a computer with Node.js 6+ and NPM installed.

## Main stuff we'll learn

* [babel][]
* [react][]
* [redux][]
* [webpack][]

## Contents

* [Day 1][day-1]
